# Rubbish Study (EN)

I always think,

Senior High School Entrance Examination,

Or Gaokao,

What's the different between them and [Imperial Examination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_examination),

It just turns [Eight-part Essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-legged_essay) into Chinese, Maths, English, History, Geography, Biology, Politic, Chemistry and Physics.

It just turns *Martial Imperial Examination* into *Physical Examination*.

China, Always is,

"You will not get a good life if you don't study very hard."

Now college students are covered all of China, and the research students are also all around us.

I don't like Chinese education.

Chinese study, for their own, for lots of money.

But foreigners study  (of cause not all) is to discover, to discover what we don't know.

This is the difference.

We are the flowers of the country.

However, we were flooded by the ocean of books in the beginning.

I have a sister, she migrated to the foreign. I asked her friend,

I said, "What did you do in the school?"

"We had much more practice time than book reading time", answered she.

Their study is alive,

But ours, is dead.

Why out study is dead ?

We got up and went to school earlier than the Sun every morning.

And back later than the Sun in the evening.

Night,

Always night,

Always the dark yellow streetlight.

What?

Where is noon? You asked me.

At noon, the sun baked you

This is summer.

**TODO: a lot of contents here are not translated now.**


But us?

Tired, tired and can't sleep even more than 7 hours!

Homework ? Yes, every teacher always think they don't give students lots of homework.

But,

As the saying goes,

"Many a little make a mickle!"

If every teachers,

Give 2 pages homework to students.

Little homework, is it?

But we have nine subjects!

And there are 15 questions in every page.

So 2 pages have 30 questions.

And 270 questions with nine subjects.

What?

We also need do the exam every day.

And take notes in the classes.

Which means we need take the pan over 400 times per day.

So please teachers don't say "Sleep early at night" anymore.

We want sleep earlier, too.

But the time is rest with you!

Okay, let we talk big exam.

Firstly, it destory the family.

And it's the devil which can damage children's heart!

It's also the EVIL MAN make students DIE!!

Even they don't know if they pass or not , commit suicide.

Not pass, commit suicide.

Pressure too big, commit suicide.

### commit suicide.

## commit suicide.

# commit suicide.

# Why

## Why

### Why

We study, study for 9 years, for 12 years, just for **AN EXAMINATION PAPER**, for **MARK**, FOR **PRIDE**.

Youth is in that paper.

Time is in that paper.

With **EVERYTHING** in that paper.

THIS IS CHINESE.


### FREEDOM!

## FREEDOM!

# FREEDOM!

> Men are born, and always continue, free and equal in respect of their rights. Civil distinctions, therefore, can be founded only on public utility.

> Political liberty consists in the power of doing whatever does not injure another.

> FROM ***Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens by The National Assembly of France***

***THIS IS WHAT WE LOVE***
